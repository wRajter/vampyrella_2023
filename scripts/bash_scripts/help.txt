Step: Filtering out rare OTUs

Minimal frequency threshold parameter:
To calculate the cut-off for excluding rare OTUs, I use the mean sample depth.
This number could be find in the otu_table_summarize.qzv table, which was created running the qiime_cluster2otu.sh script.
Then, I multiply the mean sample depth by 0.001, and round to the nearest integer.
This represents the min frequency threshold.

Step: Rarefaction curves

Maximum sequencing depth parameter:
Before creating rarefaction curves, we created the summarize table: table_filt_contam_summary.
From this summary table, we can determine the maximum depth across your samples: the maximum sample total frequency.
This number will be used as a threshold in the next step (--p-max-depth parameter).

Excluding sample(s) with based on the sequencing depth:
After creating the rarefaction_curves.qzv file, we can examine the rarefication curves.
If we want to exclude some sample(s) with poor sequencing depth, we can decide on a minimum depth cut-off.
Alternatively, proceed without exluding samples based on the sequencing depth if you want to retain all the samples.
