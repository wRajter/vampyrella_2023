# Vampyrella Environmental Sequencing 2023

## Project description
Nine environmental samples and one mock sample were sent to Integrated Microbiome Resource (IMR) for sequencing.
The full 18S and ITS rRNA amplicon fragments were sequenced by PacBio Sequel 2.
The details on DNA extraction, librabry preparation, and sequencing are described on the IMR website: https://imr.bio/protocols.html.

## Initial data
We received demultiplexed raw reads in fastq format with phred+33 encoding from IMR.
